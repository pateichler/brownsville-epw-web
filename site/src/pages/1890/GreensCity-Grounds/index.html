            <p>The Greens Division has played a vital role with ensuring that the City of Brownsville continues to be recognized as a Tree City USA Community for the past eighteen (18) years. This is a prestigious award for the City of Brownsville. The City Forester has also spent this year working on a 1,800 square foot greenhouse. The Forester’s goal for the greenhouse is to provide a nurturing location to grow seedlings to at least two to three feet in height. Currently, the greenhouse is housing over 550 seedlings (native trees) that were transplanted to pots by volunteers and will later be planted. This year alone the Forester has reviewed over 90 Site Plan reviews and completed over 100 landscaping inspections.</p>
